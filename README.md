# TabSwitchr
A Google Chrome Extension that makes navigating tabs easier

This Google Chrome Extension adds in an improved URL bar, that pops up when the macro `cmd + j` is hit.
Type in any phrase and it'll switch to the tab you're looking for, or open up a new one otherwise.

For example, if you have a GitHub tab and a Youtube page open, you can simply hit `cmd + j` to open
up the bar, then just search `git` and it'll switch to the GitHub tab.

__NOTE:__ This currently only supports Google Chrome on MacOS
